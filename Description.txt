This project implements a queue-based ticketing system in C, simulating how customers join a queue, track their waiting time, and calculate the average processing time. The program defines a Queue structure with an array to store ticket times and manages customer arrivals using functions like enqueue for adding customers, tickettime for simulating arrivals, displayind for showing individual waiting times, and averagetime for computing the average wait time. The system takes input for the number of arrivals at different times, updates the queue accordingly, and allows users to check waiting times for specific customers. This simulation helps in understanding queue-based scheduling and ticket processing logic efficiently.
